    "- `acl_list_<action>`: when choosing an ACL of type `userlist` or `grouplist` for an action, you also need to provide a list of users/groups authorized to take such action.\n",

    "- `coauthors`: names of colleagues who have also participated in the creation of the card.\n",

    "- `keywords`: a list of existing AdaLab keywords to better classify the card. If any of the chosen keywords does not exist when using this function, they will be created in the Gallery. You can see existing keywords by using [`keywords.get_keywords()`](../keywords/get_keywords.ipynb).\n",

    "  + When using `local`:\n",
    "    * The paths are absolute and, thus, must be provided in full.\n",
    "    * Folders within other folders **are**  automatically included. Thus, all files contained in a folder and its subfolders will be included. The internal structure is preserved when creating the card.\n",
    "- `picture_id`: the ID of the picture to be used in the card. If not already present in the Gallery, you can upload a new one with [`pictures.post_picture()`](../pictures/post_picture.ipynb).\n",
